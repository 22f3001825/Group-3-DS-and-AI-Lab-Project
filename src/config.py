# ── Personalized quiz gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# A student must complete this many *graded* quiz questions before the personalized
# quiz unlocks. Generated-but-unanswered questions do not count — they are not attempts.
PERSONALIZED_QUIZ_MIN_ATTEMPTS = 3

# ...covering at least this many distinct topics. The personalized quiz only draws from
# topics the student has already attempted, so this is what stops it collapsing onto a
# single topic: at MIN_ATTEMPTS=3 / MIN_TOPICS=1, one topic-wise quiz (three questions on
# one topic) unlocks a "personalized" quiz that can only ever ask about that same topic.
# Raise this to 3 to require breadth before the ranking is trusted.
